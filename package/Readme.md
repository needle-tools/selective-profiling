# Selective Profiling for Unity
## Runtime deep profiling individual methods üî¨

![](Documentation~/profiler-select.png)

With selective profiler you can choose individual methods to profile from Unity Profiler. Just select a method in the Profiler window and choose ``Profile`` to automatically get more precice information.

## Features üß¨
- Select methods in the Unity Profiler to start or stop deep profiling, at any time! No domain reload or restart needed. 
- Mark methods or classes in your project to be always deep profiled without having to turn on Deep Profiling for your whole project.

## Installation üíæ
1) 
    <details>
    <summary>Clone this repository and add OpenUPM to your project</em></summary>

    To add OpenUPM to your project:

    - open `Edit/Project Settings/Package Manager`
    - add a new Scoped Registry:
    ```
    Name: OpenUPM
    URL:  https://package.openupm.com/
    Scope(s): com.needle
    ```
    - click <kbd>Save</kbd>
    </details>

2) Add the folder named "package" to your project in Package Manager via local file path ``"com.needle.selective-profiling": "file:path/to/cloned/repo/package"``). 
3) That's it. Now you should be able to right click methods in profiler to add samples. You can find settings under ``Project Settings/Needle/Selective Profiler``

## How to use üí°
- ### How to select a method to profile
  1) You can right click a method in the profiler and enable or disable profiling
  2) You can right click a component in the inspector and select ``Profile/...`` for profiling options
  3) You can rigth click a gameobject in the hierarchy to profile all the user methods found in the hierarchy

  **NOTE**: when selecting methods in edit mode they will be saved to the selected methods list. Selected methods in playmode will not be saved.
  
- ### How to remove previously selected methods
  Open ``Project Settings/Needle/Selective Profiler`` and remove the methods you dont want to profile anymore from the profiling list. You remove a method completely by clicking the X or you can mute a method by disabling the toggle (which means it will not be profiled if any other method calls the method and deep profiling is enabled).
  
- ### How to Always deep profile classes or methods?
   Just add a ``[AlwaysProfile]`` attribute to your class or method you want to profile

## Technical background üíâ
Internally when a method gets selected for profiling we wrap every call instruction inside that selected method with ``Profiler.Begin`` and ``End`` calls. The resulting output is the same as if you would have added those calls manually in your code.

For injection we use [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony), an awesome library by Andreas Pardeike. Harmony allows to modify almost any code at runtime by modifying the underlying IL instructions.

## Known issues / limitations üò∞
- Occasionally injections break method functionality or cause errors ([see issue](https://github.com/needle-tools/selective-profiling/issues/2)). If it happens it is recommended to disabling the ``Deep Profile`` option in ``Project Settings/Needle/Selective Profiling`` or decreasing the ``Max Level``. In that case please also [open an issue](https://github.com/needle-tools/selective-profiling/issues/new) with as much information about your project and profiled method as possible.
- Generic classes or methods are currently not supported. [See issue](https://github.com/needle-tools/selective-profiling/issues/6)
- In the Profiler window currently some methods (usually ending with brackets ``()``) can be selected for profiling.
